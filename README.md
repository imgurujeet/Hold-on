> In train, cafÃ©s, airport, or crowded places, your phone is at risk. Hold On acts as your phoneâ€™s security guard â€” if someone unplugs it, a loud alarm goes off instantly to deter theft

>  **Your phone stays safe, even while charging in public.**  
HoldOn is a smart Android app that protects your phone from theft when charging outside. If someone unplugs it, a **loud alarm** starts â€” and only *you* can stop it with fingerprint or lock-screen authentication.
