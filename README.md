# âš¡ HoldOn â€“ Charging Guard & Anti-Unplug Alarm
![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imgurujeet/Hold-on/refs/heads/main/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.webp)

> In trains, cafÃ©s, airports, or even at home, your phone is always at risk. HoldOn acts like your personal phone bodyguard â€” if someone unplugs it, a **loud alarm** goes off instantly to stop them in their tracks.

> âš¡ **Even if you leave your phone charging at home and someone unplugs it, HoldOn has your back.**  
HoldOn is a smart Android app that protects your phone from theft or unauthorized unplugging. The alarm is loud enough to grab your attention, and only *you* can stop it using fingerprint or lock-screen authentication.
