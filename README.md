![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imgurujeet/Hold-on/refs/heads/main/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.webp)


>  **Your phone stays safe, even while charging in public.**  
HoldOn is a smart Android app that protects your phone from theft when charging outside. If someone unplugs it, a **loud alarm** starts — and only *you* can stop it with fingerprint or lock-screen authentication.

## FAQ

#### Q1: Does HoldOn work when the app is closed?

No, the alarm can only be stopped via **biometric or lock-screen authentication** for maximum security.

#### Q3: Will the app drain my battery?
No, HoldOn is lightweight and only monitors the charging state, so it uses minimal battery.

#### Q4: Can I customize the alarm sound?
Yes, you can set your own alarm sound from `res/raw/` or future settings updates.
