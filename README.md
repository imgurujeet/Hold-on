# ⚡Hold On – Anti-Theft Alarm
![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imgurujeet/Hold-on/refs/heads/main/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.webp)

> In trains, cafés, airports, crowded markets, or even at home, your phone is always at risk. HoldOn acts like your personal phone bodyguard — if someone unplugs it or tries to remove it suspiciously, a **loud alarm** goes off instantly to stop them in their tracks.

> ⚡ Whether you're charging in public or carrying your phone in a crowded place, HoldOn has your back.  
HoldOn is a smart Android security app that protects your phone from pickpocketing and unauthorized charger unplugging. The alarm is loud enough to grab attention instantly, and only *you* can stop it using fingerprint, Face Unlock, or lock-screen authentication.
